### 8-Bit Plane Slicing


### Median Filter
Median Filter is an order-statistic filter that replaces the value of a pixel by the median of the gray levels in the neighborhood of that pixel (the original value of the pixel is included in the computation of the median). Median filters are particularly effective in the presence of both bipolar and unipolar impulse noise.
